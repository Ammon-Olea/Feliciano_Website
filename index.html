				<h1 class = "whatdino">Dinosaurs?</h1>
				<h1 class = "block2">Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya; their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.</h1>
			</div>
				<h1 class = "block3">Both avian and non-avian dinosaurs evolved from a more ancient group of reptiles roughly 240 million years ago, diversifying in shape and size before mostly dying out in a mass extinction event around 65 million years ago.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block4">In fact, while dinosaurs are commonly seen as extinct and known only by their fossils, paleontologists technically include modern birds as a surviving group of avian dinosaurs.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block5">The name dinosaur comes from the Greek words deinos (“terrible” or “fearfully great”) and sauros (“reptile” or “lizard”). The English anatomist Richard Owen proposed the formal term Dinosauria in 1842 to include three giant extinct animals (Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, and Hylaeosaurus) represented by large fossilized bones that had been unearthed at several locations in southern England during the early part of the 19th century.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block6">Owen recognized that these reptiles were far different from other known reptiles of the present and the past for three reasons: they were large yet obviously terrestrial, unlike the aquatic ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs that were already known; they had five vertebrae in their hips, whereas most known reptiles have only two; and, rather than holding their limbs sprawled out to the side in the manner of lizards, dinosaurs held their limbs under the body in columnar fashion, like elephants and other large mammals.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block7">Originally applied to just a handful of incomplete specimens, the clade Dinosauria now encompasses more than 800 generic names and at least 1,000 species, with new names being added to the roster every year as the result of scientific explorations around the world. Not all of these names are valid taxa, however.A great many of them have been based on fragmentary or incomplete material that may actually have come from two or more different dinosaurs. In addition, bones have sometimes been misidentified as dinosaurian when they are not from dinosaurs at all. Nevertheless, dinosaurs are well documented by abundant fossil remains recovered from every continent on Earth, and the number of known dinosaurian taxa is estimated to be 10–25 percent of actual past diversity.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block8">The extensive fossil record of genera and species is testimony that dinosaurs were diverse animals, with widely varying lifestyles and adaptations. Their remains are found in sedimentary rock layers (strata) dating to the Late Triassic Epoch (approximately 237 million to 201.3 million years ago). The abundance of their fossilized bones is substantive proof that dinosaurs were the dominant form of terrestrial animal life during the Mesozoic Era (about 252.2 million to 66 million years ago). It is likely that the known remains represent a very small fraction (probably less than 0.0001 percent) of all the individual dinosaurs that once lived.</h1>
				<h1 class = "types">Types of Dinosaurs</h1>
		<div class = "row1">
			<div class = "c1">
				<img class = "hips" src = "https://www.factinate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/42-1.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class = "c1">
				<h1 class = "block9">There are three main clades of dinosaur, or evolutionarily linked categories. Precisely how each of these related to each other is still a matter of debate.</h1>
			</div>
				<h1 class = "block10">In order to understand any type of animal, it is always helpful to find subdivisions, usually by looking at an easily observed feature. Traditionally, dinosaurs have been divided into two orders, based on the shape of their hips. These orders are known as saurischia and ornithischia. The former order have hips shaped like those of lizards – hence. they are lizard-hipped, which is what saurischia means.The latter order have hips shaped like birds, so they are known as bird-hipped – and that is what ornithischia means. The saurischia order includes sauropods and therapods.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block11">Sauropods are the large, long-necked, long-tailed dinosaurs, like apatosaurus and diplodocus. Therapods are the allegedly fierce meat-eaters, like tyrannosaurus, allosaurus, and oviraptor. Ornithischians include stegosauruses and ceratopsians – the group that includes triceratops. </h1>
				<h1 class = "block12">As we know, evolutionists believe that birds evolved from dinosaurs. So, obviously birds evolved from bird-hipped dinosaurs, right? Wrong. Evolutionists believe that birds evolved from therapods, which are lizard-hipped. </h1>
				<h1 class = "block13">The division between bird-hipped and lizard-hipped creatures is so old that even I remember reading about it in childhood dinosaur books. But now modern evolutionists are abandoning the theory, suggesting that therapods evolved from within the ornithischian kind, somehow temporarily producing lizard-hips, which would evolve back into bird-hips. </h1>
				<h1 class = "whatteeth">What Teeth Tell Us</h1>
		<div class = "row1">
			<div class = "c1">
				<img class = "teeth" src = "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/60/91/52/609152638ffe7ef530a8438456e6f35d.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class = "c1">
				<h1 class = "block14">We know about dinosaurs and other living things from long ago because of fossils. Theres are usually hard body parts, such as bones, claws, horns, and scales, unable to decompose, and instead, become preserved and fossilized in rocks for millions of years. Dinosaur teeth were very hard and formed many fossils.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block15">The shape of a dinosaur's teeth help to show what it ate. Edmontosaurus was a 12-meter-long duck-billed dinosaur, and had rows of broad, wide, teeth in the sides of its mouth. This told us that it was an herbivore because the teeth it had were ideal for chewing tough plant foods like twigs and old leaves. On the other hand, the Velociraptor had sharp, serrated teeth, indicating that it was a carnivore.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block16">By looking at the size, shape, curvature, wear, and numerous other details of teeth, scientists can discern not just what the dinosaur ate, but also intricacies on how it ate, and how it fit in with the other animals and plants in its ecosystem.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block17">Most dinosaurs replace their teeth very rapidly, with some adults going through thousands of teeth in their lifetimes. This process is continuous and as the crowns are shed other teeth take their place and the root of the tooth is absorbed. Because of this dissociated dinosaur teeth without crowns are quite common in the fossil record. Rooted teeth are much rarer, the root of a tooth is quite fragile and the tooth would have to come from an animal’s skull after death has already occurred.<h1>
			</div>
				<h1 class = "block18">Unerupted teeth are occasionally found as well. These teeth never passed through the gum tissues while the animal was alive so they show no feeding wear.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block19">Some dinosaurs such as the Gallimimus and other ornithomimids did not even have any teeth at all. It had a beak with ridges used for feeding on tough plant material, indicative of a herbivorous diet.</h1>
				<h1 class = "feet">Tracks Tell History</h1>
		<div class = "row1">
			<div class = "c1">
				<img class = "track" src = "https://www.mydinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dinosaurs-Footprint-Explore-400x255.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class = "c1">
				<h1 class = "block20">Preserved footprints, also known as ichnites, are a type of trace fossil and a window into the lives of dinosaurs.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block21">The impression or print left behind when an animal's hand or foot pushes into the ground is called a track. Where they directly impact the ground is referred to as a true track. </h1>
				<h1 class = "block22">As an animal takes a step, the ground below the hand or foot is compressed. This displacement forms features below the true track. These are known as undertracks, underprints, ghost prints or transmitted tracks.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block23">It is almost impossible to tell exactly which species of dinosaur made a track - for example, many theropods have similar-looking three-toed feet. Additionally, bones and tracks don't line up exactly - the bones lack the soft tissue that was part of the foot or hand that made the print</h1>
			</div>
				<h1 class = "block24">Instead, ichnologists are generally able to identify which dinosaur group made a track using clues such as the size and shape of a print. Geographic location and the age of the rocks may help narrow down the potential species.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block25">Experts can also determine whether a trackway was made by a bipedal or quadrupedal dinosaur - one that moved on two or four legs. Bipedal footprints were made by either theropods or ornithopods - although some of the latter, such as Mantellisaurus, are believed to have spent time on all-fours as well. </h1>
				<h1 class = "block26">The number of toes, the size of the foot, the length of the toes, the ground the creature was walking on, how they distributed their weight, whether or not they walked on the tips of their toes or they walked with palms flat on the floor, all contribute to the identification of the animal that made the print.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block27">In prints produced in perfect conditions, scientists may be able to spot skin impressions or other evidence of the animals' soft anatomy, as well as claw marks and indications of how flexible the digits were. Tracks are a record of how a dinosaur moved. Trackways show how long a dinosaur's stride was. This can be interpreted from the spacing of the prints. It is sometimes also possible to estimate how fast the dinosaur was moving.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block28">A series of parallel tracks may suggest that animals were moving in a group and could indicate possible herd behaviour. Some experts propose that some trackways with prints made by different types of dinosaurs are evidence of prehistoric chase scenes. However, predator and prey prints in the same place may have been made hours or even weeks apart.</h1>
				<h1 class = "flight">Birds of a Feather</h1>
		<div class = "row1">
			<div class = "c1">
				<img class = "feather" src = "https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.uvKhQr1RZYyQngRgmoLHYAHaFj&pid=Api&P=0">

				<img class = "feather2" src = "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JNABN6pyTjk/Wl4DK8E_4PI/AAAAAAAAOlI/i86L21K1FLMzo4ped1imvJRz79nmtH31ACLcBGAs/s1600/Scientists%2BDiscover%2B161%2BMillion-year-old%2B%2527Rainbow%2BDinosaur%2527%2BWith%2BIridescent%2BFeathers__15.jpg">
			</div>
				<h1 class = "block29">There are two main types of dinosaurs with feathers. The first were theropods, bipedal carnivores that had wings, and the second group was the sauropods, which were enormous, long-necked herbivores. Although they were not the only ones to have feathers, scientists believe that the feathers were an ancestral trait.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block30">However, feathers are more useful than just for flight. Many birds use them for odd purposes, from being sensory apparatuses to being protective. In water, the feathers of waterfowl give them buoyancy. In desert areas, desert birds use them to absorb water and help them stay dry. If this is the case, dinosaurs may have been the first to utilize these feathers.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block31">Their feathers were developed as a means to regulate temperature, and they were not shaped like modern feathers. They were more akin to hair, or a monofilament.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block32">The dinosaur feathers feature a poorly defined central shaft (rachis) and appear to keel to either side of the tail. The open, flexible structure of the feathers is more similar to modern ornamental feathers than to flight feathers, which have well-defined central shafts, branches, sub-branches, and hooks that latch the structure together.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block33">A study of pterosaur fossils published in 2019 described the presence of branching featherlike structures called pycnofibres in pterosaur fossils dating to about 160 million years ago. These feathers appeared in tufts; they were not simple and straight, which suggests that the origin of feathers predated both the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs and occurred in a common ancestor some 250 million years old or older.</h1>
				<h1 class = "claw">Killer Claws</h1>

			</div>
				<h1 class = "block34">Nearly all dinosaurs had claws on their fingers and toes. These claws were shaped for different jobs in different dinosaurs. They were made from a tough substance called keratin - the same as your fingernails and toenails.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block35">Deinonychus, meaning "terrible claw", had long, hooked claws on its hands. These helped it to grab its victims and tear at their skin and flesh. It also had a huge hooked claw,as big as your hand, on the second toe of each foot. This could flick down like a pointed knife to slash oieces out of prey.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block36">It probably had feathers like other raptors. It lived in North America around 110 million years ago.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block37">The biggest claws of any dinosaurs, and any animals, belonged to the scythe dinosaurs or therizinosaurs. Their hand claws, up to one meter long, were perhaps to pull down and cut off leafy branches as food, or even for self-defense against predators. Therizinosaurs were big, strange-looking dinosaurs, reaching 10 meters long and 5 tons in weight. They lived late in the Age of Dinosaurs, and the group included dinosaurs such as Alxasaurus, Nothronychus, Beipiaosaurus, and Therizinosaurus.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block38">Other dinosaurs such as the Iguanodon had claws on its feet. But these were rounded and blunt and looked more like hooves. There were also stubby claws on the fingers, while the thumb claw was longer and shaped like a spike, perhaps for stabbing enemies or predators.</h1>
				<h1 class = "senses">Look! Listen! Sniff!</h1>

			</div>
				<h1 class = "block39">Just like reptiles of today, dinosaurs could see, hear, and smell he world around them. We know this from fossils. The preserved fossil skulls had spaces for eues, ears, and nostrils.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block40">Some dinosaurs, such as the Troodon, a 2 meter-long carnivore that lived in North America, around 70 million years ago, had large, bowl-shaped hollows in their fossil skulls to allow for them to see very well, possibly suggesting nocturnal activity. Experts also found that it had spaces on the sides of its skull where it had its ears. It showed that Troodon could hear the tiny noises of little animals moving about in the dark.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block41">There are also spaces on the sides of the head where Troodon had its ears. Dinosaur ears were round and flat, like the ears of other reptiles. Troodon had a fairly good sense of hearing, being able to hear tiny noises of little animals moving about in the dark. </h1>
				<h1 class = "block42">The nostrils of Troodon were two holes at the front of its snout. With its delicate sense of smell, Troodon could sniff out prey of insects, worms, little reptiles such as lizards, and small shrew-like mammals.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block43">Dinosaurs used their eyes, ears, and noses not only to find food, but also to detect enemies - and each other. Parasaurolophus, a duck-billed dinosaur, around 10 meters long, that lived 80 million years ago in North America, had a long, hollow tube-like crest on its head. Perhaps it blew air along this to make a noise like a trumpet, as an elephant does today with its trunk.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block44">Parasaurolophus may have made noises to send messages to other members of their group or herd. Different messages could tell the others about finding food or warning them about enemies.</h1>
				<h1 class = "fast">How Fast?</h1>

				<h1 class = "block45">Dinosaurs walked and ran at different speeds, according to their size and shape. In the world today, cheetahs and ostriches are slim with long legs and run very fast, Elephants and hippos are huge heavyweights and plod along more slowly. Dinosaurs were similar. Some were big, heavy, and slow. Others were slim, light, and speedy.</h1>
			</div>
				<h1 class = "block46">The fastest dinosaurs were the ostrich dinosaurs, or the ornithomimosaurs. They had similar body shape and proportions to today's biggest and fastest-running bird, the ostrich. Ornithomimus, from North America 70-65 million years ago, was one of the largest, up to 5 meters long and 300 kilograms in weight. It had powerful back legs, and hollow bones, just like a bird, to save weight.</h1>

			</div>	
				<h1 class = "block47">Some dinosaurs had body defences against predators. These might be large horns and spikes, or thick, hard lumps of bone like armor-plating. Most armored dinosaurs were herbivorous. They had to defend themselves against big, carnivorous predators.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block48">Triceratops, a 9 meter-long ceratopsian, weighing more than 5 tons, from North America 65 million years ago, had three horns, one on its nose and two much longer ones above its eyes. It also had a wide shield-like piece of bone over its neck and shoulders. The horns and neck frill made Triceratops look very fearsome, despite being an herbivore. If attacked, Triceratops could charge and jab with its horns, like a rhino today.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block49">Another ceratopsian, Styracosaurus, 6 meters long, had upto six hors as long as one meter extended from the frill's edge, giving this dinosaur and even more intimidating appearance.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block50">Euoplocephalus had a great lump of bone on its tail. This measured almost one meter across and looked like a massive hammer or club, It could swing its tail at predators to protect itself from attacks. It had a long, straight, powerful tail to swing the club. The tail club was made from several fused bones.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block51">Euoplocephalus belonged to a group called ankylosaurs. With big bony sheets and lumps in its skin, they were the most armored out of all the dinosaurs.</h1>

				<h1 class = "block52">Like most reptiles of today's era, dinosaurs produced young by laying eggs. These hatched out into baby dinosaus that gradually grew into adults.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block53">This might come as a shock but we have only known about how dinosaurs were born for 95 years. Explorer Roy Chapman Andrews discovered the first fossilized dinosaur nest ever known to science in the Gobi Desert in 1923.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block54">Ever since, many kinds of dinosaur eggs and babies have been found. These include those of small, strong-beaked Oviraptor from Central Asia and the early sauropod Massospondylus from South Africa. Different dinosaurs laid different sizes and shapes of eggs. Huge sauropod dinosaurs such as Brachiosaurus probably laid rounded eggs as big as basketballs. Eggs of big meat-eaters like Tyrannosaurus were more sausage-shaped, 40 centimeters long and 15 centimeters wide.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block55">Some dinosaurs made nests for their eggs. Oviraptor lived more than 75 million years ago in what is now the Gobi Desert of Asia. It probably scraped a bowl-shaped nest in the soil about one meter across. Into this it laid about 15-20 eggs, in a neat, spiral shape.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block56">Fossils of baby dinosaurs show that they looked very much like their parents. However some proportions may have been a bit off such as the neck frill of a young Protoceratops. It was not as large when compared to the rest of its body as in the adult. As the youngster's body grew, the frill grew faster, so its relative size changed. Other dinosaurs' body proportions also changed as they grew older. Some baby dinosaurs grew up to five times faster than human babies. A newly-hatched Diplodocus was already a meter long and weighed 8 kilograms.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block57">Dinosaur eggs probably hatched after a few weeks or months, depending on how warm it was. The eggshells were slightly leathery and bendy, like most reptile eggshells found today, and not brittle or hard like the eggshells of modern birds.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block58">Recent fossil discoveries show that some dinosaurs looked after their young, like crocodiles of today. In one find, an adult Protoceratops was preserved while protecting its eggs from a hungry Velociraptor.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block59">Some dinosaurs may have even cared for their young after they left the nest. Psittacosaurus was a 2-meter-long plant-eater that lived around 110-130 million years ago in East Asia. One set of fossils from China in 2003 suggests that one adult was guarding 34 babies when they all died together, perhaps because the tunnel they were hiding in collapsed.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block60">Some fossils show unhatched eggs broken into many small parts, as though squashed by the babies that had already hatched out</h1>
			</div>
				<h1 class = "end">A Closed Chapter</h1>
				<img class = "ded" src = "https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/1-end-of-the-dinosaurs-detlev-van-ravenswaayscience-photo-library.jpg">
				<h1 class = "block61">About 65 million years ago, the Age of Dinosaurs came to a sudden end. Fossils preserved in the rocks show that creatures like fish, insects, birds, and mammals carried on. What happened to kill off some of the biggest, most successful animals the world has ever seen? There are many ideas. It could have been one disaster, or a combination of several.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block62">The disaster may have been caused by a giant lump of rock, an asteroid or meteorite. This came from outer space and smashed into Earth. The impact threw up vast clouds of water, rocks, ash, and dust that blotted out the Sun for many years. Plants could not undergo photosynthesis due to the lack of sunlight. No plants mean no plant-eaters. No plant-eaters mean no meat-eaters.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block63">Many volcanoes around the Earth could have erupted at the same time, perhaps due to the impact of the meteorite. They threw out lava, ash, dust, and hazardous gas. Creatures would have choked to death.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block64">The catastrophe might have involved a terrible disease that eventually spread among a specific group of animals and killed them off.</h1>
				<h1 class = "block65">For the eggs of the dinosaurs, it might be that they were eaten by early mammals, other animals, or crushed. Even if they were to have hatched, the disease would have killed them too.</h1>
